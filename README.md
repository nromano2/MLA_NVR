This repository is for the machine learning assignments completed for the CS430 Machine Learning in the Cloud Fall 2024 course at Bellarmine University.  

## MLA1_NVR
The `MLA1_NVR` folder contains the first machine learning assignment completed in the CS430 Machine Learning in the Cloud course. Within this folder is the `weather_2012.csv` dataset for this assignment. In this assignment, I worked with some of the features within the pandas and matplotlib libraries to understand and visualize the data.
