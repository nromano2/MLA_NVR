# MLA_NVR  
This repository is for the machine learning assignments completed for the CS430 Machine Learning in the Cloud Fall 2024 course at Bellarmine University.  

## MLA1_NVR
The `MLA1_NVR` folder contains the first machine learning assignment completed in the CS430 Machine Learning in the Cloud course. Within this folder is the `weather_2012.csv` dataset for this assignment. In this assignment, I worked with some of the features within the pandas and matplotlib libraries to understand and visualize the data.  

## MLA2_NVR
The `MLA2_NVR` folder contains the second machine learning assignment completed in the CS430 Machine Learning in the Cloud course. Within this folder is the `Steel_industry_data.csv` dataset for this assignment. For this assignment, I created pipelines that transformed the input variable columns and created a linear regression model and a logistic regression model of the data.

## MLA3_NVR
The `MLA3_NVR` folder contains the third machine learning assignment completed in the CS430 Machine Learning in the Cloud course. Within this folder are the two datasets used in the assignment: `Steel_industry_data.csv` and `banknote_authentication.csv`. For this assignment, I was tasked with created pipelines that transformed the input variable columns and ran a SVM Classifer model on the `banknote_authentication.csv` data and a SVM Regression model on the `Steel_industry_data.csv` data.

## MLA4_NVR
The `MLA4_NVR` folder contains the fourth machine learning assignment completed in the CS430 Machine Learning in the Cloud course. Within this folder are the two datasets that were used in the Google Colab Notebook `MLA4_NVR.ipynb` file. The two dataset names are `Steel_industry_data.csv` and `banknote_authentication.csv`. For this assignment, I was tasked with creating pipelines to transform the data and run a Decision Tree Regression and a Decision Tree Classifier models.
