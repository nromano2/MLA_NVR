# MLA_NVR  
This repository is for the machine learning assignments completed for the CS430 Machine Learning in the Cloud Fall 2024 course at Bellarmine University.  

## MLA1_NVR
The `MLA1_NVR` folder contains the first machine learning assignment completed in the CS430 Machine Learning in the Cloud course. Within this folder is the `weather_2012.csv` dataset for this assignment. In this assignment, I worked with some of the features within the pandas and matplotlib libraries to understand and visualize the data.  

## MLA2_NVR
The `MLA2_NVR` folder contains the second machine learning assignment completed in the CS430 Machine Learning in the Cloud course. Within this folder is the `Steel_industry_data.csv` dataset for this assignment. For this assignment, I created pipelines that transformed the input variable columns and created a linear regression model and a logistic regression model of the data.

## MLA3_NVR
The `MLA3_NVR` folder contains the third machine learning assignment completed in the CS430 Machine Learning in the Cloud course. Within this folder are the two datasets used in the assignment: `Steel_industry_data.csv` and `banknote_authentication.csv`. For this assignment, I was tasked with created pipelines that transformed the input variable columns and ran a SVM Classifer model on the `banknote_authentication.csv` data and a SVM Regression model on the `Steel_industry_data.csv` data.
